   Loading image modes
<- --------------------- ->

-1, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. it is the defaukt flag.
0, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
1, cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads an image as such including alpha channel

an image in ooen cv is a numpy array

#hsv --> hue saturation lightness
ALOT OF THE ALGORITHMS IN OPEN CV REQUIRE GREYSCALE
t5
to convert a color
BGR_color = np.arrsy([[[255, 0,0]]])
print(cv2.cvtColor(BGR_color, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)) --> would print hsv
x[0][0]
